# FoxForge GG

**Forge your UNITE loadout!** A build optimizer for Pokémon UNITE that helps
players design optimized builds — recommending Emblem loadouts and Held Items
tailored to a selected Pokémon, with real-time stat calculation and
level-scaling visualization.

## Install & Run

Three ways to use the tool — pick whichever suits you.

### 1. Use it in your browser (no install)

Open the hosted web app: **<https://aerokita.github.io/FoxForge-GG/>**

It's a PWA, so you can "Install" it from the browser for an app-like, offline-capable
window. It updates automatically on reload.

### 2. Download the desktop app

Grab the latest installer from the
**[Releases page](https://github.com/AeroKita/FoxForge-GG/releases/latest)**:

| OS | Download |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | the `*_x64-setup.exe` installer (or `*_x64_en-US.msi`) |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | the `*_aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | the `*_x64.dmg` |
| Linux | the `.AppImage`, `.deb`, or `.rpm` |

The desktop app **auto-updates** itself when a new version is released. The binaries
are ad-hoc signed but **not** signed with a paid Apple/Microsoft certificate, so the
OS shows a one-time warning on first launch — a normal double-click will be blocked:

- **macOS:** open the `.dmg`, drag the app to Applications, then **right-click the app
  → Open → Open** (a plain double-click won't work). If you ever see *"app is damaged
  and can't be opened,"* the download was quarantined — clear it once in Terminal:

  ```bash
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/FoxForge GG.app"
  ```

- **Windows:** on the SmartScreen prompt, click **More info → Run anyway**.

> For a true one-click install (no warnings), the app would need an Apple Developer ID
> (notarization) and a Windows Authenticode certificate — see
> [docs/07-distribution.md](docs/07-distribution.md).

### 3. Run from source

Requires **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20+**. Clone, install, and start the dev server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AeroKita/FoxForge-GG.git
cd FoxForge-GG
npm install
npm run dev        # open the printed URL (default http://localhost:5173)
```

For the **desktop app from source** you also need the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs);
then `npm run tauri dev` runs it and `npm run tauri build` produces an installer for your
current OS in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Cutting a new release

Pushing a version tag triggers [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml), which builds
installers for all platforms and publishes them — with a signed `latest.json` auto-update
manifest — to the Releases page:

```bash
# bump "version" in package.json + src-tauri/tauri.conf.json first, then:
git tag v0.1.2 && git push origin v0.1.2
```

The signing secret (`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`) is already configured in the repo. See
[docs/07-distribution.md](docs/07-distribution.md) for the full distribution model.

## Layout

**Engine (pure, tested)**
- [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts) — core data model
- [`src/engine/formulas.ts`](src/engine/formulas.ts) — stat stacking, mitigation, RSB damage, eHP
- [`src/engine/emblems.ts`](src/engine/emblems.ts) — emblem loadout aggregation (flats + set bonuses)
- [`src/engine/attackSpeed.ts`](src/engine/attackSpeed.ts) — AS-points → frame-breakpoint → attacks/sec
- [`src/engine/effects.ts`](src/engine/effects.ts) — toggleable active boosts (X-Atk, RFS proc, moves)
- [`src/engine/derive.ts`](src/engine/derive.ts) — Loadout → effective stats + attack speed (one path)

**Data (versioned, update-able)**
- [`src/data/patch-1.23.1.1.json`](src/data/patch-1.23.1.1.json) — full game bundle (94 Pokémon,
  41 held items, 10 battle items, 258 emblems), community-sourced from UNITE-DB
- [`src/data/attackSpeedBoosts.json`](src/data/attackSpeedBoosts.json) — AS boost catalog
  (10 global items + 61 per-Pokémon move buffs with level gating)
- [`src/data/loadBundle.ts`](src/data/loadBundle.ts) — zod-validated bundle loading
- `public/assets/` — mirrored art (497 images: portraits, thumbnails, item & emblem icons)

**App (React)**
- [`src/state/`](src/state) — `loadout.ts` (model + localStorage, 20-loadout cap) + `store.tsx` (reducer/context)
- [`src/components/`](src/components) — PokemonPicker, LoadoutEditor, StatPanel, LoadoutBar, CompareView, PickerModal

**Tooling**
- `tools/community/` — UNITE-DB scraper + normalizers (`fetch.py`, `normalize.py`, `fetch_art.py`,
  `normalize_as_boosts.py` — dissects `docs/Attack Speed Calculator.xlsx`)
- `tools/extract/` — first-party APK pipeline (**blocked**: rotated bundle encryption,
  see [ENCRYPTION-FINDINGS.md](tools/extract/ENCRYPTION-FINDINGS.md))

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev                     # vite dev server — the app
npm run build                   # production static site → dist/ (portable: base "./")
npm run build:pages             # static build with the GitHub Pages base path
npm run preview                 # serve the built dist/ locally
npm run tauri dev               # run the native desktop app (needs the Rust toolchain)
npm run tauri build             # build a desktop installer for the current OS
npm test                        # engine + bundle + attack-speed + share tests (vitest, 58)
npm run validate                # known-values gate from docs/03-Calculation-Engine.md
npx tsx src/data/verifyPatch.ts # validate the live UNITE-DB bundle end-to-end
npm run typecheck               # tsc --noEmit
```

## Deploying

`npm run build` emits a self-contained static site in `dist/` (≈258 KB gzipped JS + the
art). Because `vite.config.ts` sets `base: "./"` and images resolve through
[`src/ui/asset.ts`](src/ui/asset.ts), the same build works at a domain root, a sub-path
(GitHub Pages project site), or via `npm run preview` — just drop `dist/` on any static host.

## Updating game data

Everything numeric lives in versioned JSON, refreshed by scripts (never hand-edited):

```bash
cd tools/community && source ../extract/.venv/bin/activate
python3 fetch.py                # re-scrape UNITE-DB (pokemon/items/emblems/stats)
python3 normalize.py            # → src/data/patch-<patch>.json (zod-validated)
python3 fetch_art.py            # refresh public/assets/ icons & portraits
python3 normalize_as_boosts.py  # → src/data/attackSpeedBoosts.json from the xlsx
```

To add an active combat effect (e.g. a new item's in-combat buff), extend the catalog
in `attackSpeedBoosts.json` or the resolver in `src/engine/effects.ts` — the UI toggles
and recompute pick it up automatically.

## Status

- [x] Milestone 1 — calculation engine + tests (all validation targets pass)
- [x] Milestone 2 — game data + art (community-sourced from UNITE-DB; APK datamining
  blocked by rotated encryption, pipeline preserved in `tools/extract/`)
- [x] Milestone 3 — core UI: Pokémon picker, loadout editor (3 held + trainer item + 10
  emblems), live StatPanel, attack-speed calculator, active/inactive effect toggles
  (incl. X-Attack +20% Atk/SpAtk & +25% AS), loadout saver (20, localStorage), two-build comparison
- [x] Milestone 4 — level-scaling graph ([`LevelGraph.tsx`](src/components/LevelGraph.tsx),
  Recharts, any stat or attacks/sec across Lv 1–15 with current-level marker)
- [x] Milestone 5 — recommendation engine ([`recommend.ts`](src/engine/recommend.ts) +
  [`RecommendPanel.tsx`](src/components/RecommendPanel.tsx)): surfaces each Pokémon's **curated
  UNITE-DB builds** (held/battle items + the **exact 10-emblem set** with grades + resulting set
  bonuses), **Reroll** to cycle a Pokémon's builds, and **Randomize** — a negative-minimizing emblem
  solver ([respects per-stat floors + attack-type "unneeded" stats](src/engine/recommend.ts)) for
  fresh sets and the few Pokémon without curated builds; one-click Apply
- [x] **Beginner / Expert modes** ([App.tsx](src/App.tsx)): Beginner shows the recommended build +
  clean rounded stats; Expert adds attack-speed detail, analytics, active-effect toggles, the level
  graph, Compare, and decimal precision. Every section is a **collapsible card**
  ([`CollapsibleCard.tsx`](src/components/CollapsibleCard.tsx), persisted open state).
- [x] **Emblem Inventory Manager** ([`InventoryManager.tsx`](src/components/InventoryManager.tsx)):
  bulk-mark owned emblems per grade (Bronze/Silver/Gold tabs, color filter, search, "Own all shown",
  live counts) — feeds the per-grade owned store.
- [x] Quality-of-life — combat analytics (physical/special eHP + relative basic-attack output),
  **shareable build links** (`#b=` URL hash), auto-persisted current build, **per-grade owned-emblem
  inventory** (Bronze/Silver/Gold favorited independently via the picker's grade toggle; "owned only"
  filter; recommendations prefer owned), Bronze/Silver/Gold swappable per equipped emblem,
  **emblem-set summary** ([`EmblemSetSummary.tsx`](src/components/EmblemSetSummary.tsx): net flat
  stats color-coded + per-color counts & active set bonus), **styled hover tooltips**
  ([`Tooltip.tsx`](src/components/Tooltip.tsx)) on emblems/held/trainer items, Clear button, portable static build
- [x] **Themes** — light + dark (neon "Neo"-derived palette), toggleable in the header and
  persisted; all surfaces read from semantic Tailwind tokens ([`src/index.css`](src/index.css)).
- [x] **Distribution** ([docs/07-distribution.md](docs/07-distribution.md)) — hosted web app +
  installable PWA on [GitHub Pages](https://aerokita.github.io/FoxForge-GG/)
  ([`pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml)), plus native desktop installers for
  Windows/macOS/Linux built in CI on a version tag ([`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml))
  with **signed Tauri auto-updates** ([`UpdatePanel.tsx`](src/components/UpdatePanel.tsx)). Game-data
  updates are fetched at runtime from Pages, so a patch needs no app rebuild.

### Deliberately not built
- **Nintendo / Pokémon UNITE account login** to read owned emblems — there is no official public
  OAuth for third parties; the only route would be handling the user's Nintendo credentials, a
  security/ToS line not worth crossing. The local owned-emblem inventory delivers the same UX safely.

### Open refinements
- Per-move AS level-availability is best-effort; emblem-set quick presets; code-splitting the 1 MB bundle
- Optional OS code-signing certs (Apple Developer ID / Windows Authenticode) for warning-free installs
