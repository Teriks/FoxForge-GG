# FoxForge GG

Agent-oriented project context for **FoxForge GG** (`unite-build-optimizer`) — a Pokémon UNITE build optimizer with a pure calculation engine, versioned game data, and a React UI. Deeper dives live in `docs/`.

This document describes the codebase as it exists today on `main`.

## Product Context

### Target Audience

Pokémon UNITE players ranging from casual newcomers to competitive optimizers who want to design, compare, and share emblem and held-item loadouts without manually crunching in-game math.

### Use Cases

- Select a Pokémon and assemble a loadout (up to 10 emblems, 3 held items, trainer/battle item) with live effective-stat feedback.
- Tune each held item's grade (1–40) — tap-to-type via shared `GradeField` on the Held Items page and in the Builder (Build held-item slots also keep a grade slider); pick each Pokémon's two final (upgraded) moves; both feed the live stats. Unique Items (Mega Stones and Rusted Sword) have no grade stats or grade UI on either surface (`isUniqueHeldItem` in `gameData.ts`).
- Visualize how a build scales from level 1–15, including attack-speed breakpoints and active combat boosts.
- Browse curated community builds (UNITE-DB sourced), apply them in one click, or get emblem recommendations constrained by an owned-inventory model.
- Search for optimal 10-emblem builds on the Optimize tab (Basic one-tap search with owned-inventory defaults, or Advanced pool/effort/priority/color controls with exact enumeration when the grade-aware search space fits under the cap) and apply results to the current loadout.
- Save up to 20 loadouts locally, compare two builds side-by-side (Recommended/Creative presets, the current working build, or saved loadouts), and share builds via URL hash.
- Use the tool as a hosted PWA or local dev build.

### Key Benefits

- Accuracy-first stat engine that mirrors in-game stacking order, rounding, mitigation, RSB damage, and attack-speed frame logic.
- Rich visual presentation (portraits, item/emblem icons) with Basic vs Advanced modes to balance simplicity and depth (optimizer controls, Compare tab, emblem stat precision, and move/passive tooltip text).
- Patchable game data via versioned JSON bundles—no code changes required for balance updates.
- Offline-capable distribution via PWA install.

### Success Criteria

- Calculations pass documented validation targets and known-value gates (`docs/03-Calculation-Engine.md`, `npm run validate`).
- Casual users can apply a recommended build and understand resulting stats without jargon.
- Advanced users can tune emblem grades, toggle active effects, inspect analytics, and compare builds precisely.
- Game data and art can be refreshed from community tooling without breaking the app schema (zod-validated bundles).

### Key Constraints

- No Nintendo/UNITE account integration—owned emblems are tracked locally for security and ToS reasons.
- First-party APK datamining is blocked (rotated bundle encryption); community UNITE-DB sourcing is the live data path.
- Game accuracy is non-negotiable: stacking order and rounding rules must match in-game behavior.
- AGPL-3.0-only license; distribution is the GitHub Pages web app (PWA).

## Architecture & Patterns

### How This System Works

FoxForge GG is a three-layer app: a **pure calculation engine**, a **versioned data layer**, and a **React UI** that never reimplements game math inline.

User edits flow through `src/state/store.tsx` (reducer + context) into a `Loadout` model (`src/state/loadout.ts`, persisted in localStorage). Every stat display path calls `deriveBuild` / `deriveAtLevel` in `src/engine/derive.ts`, which is the single aggregation point: emblem flats and set bonuses → held items → active toggles → attack speed, plus a separate out-of-combat move speed (`oocMoveSpeed`). The in-combat `effective` block uses `inCombat: true` (yellow's move-speed set bonus applies only out of combat). `oocMoveSpeed` re-derives move speed with `inCombat: false`, then layers grade-scaled OOC held-item %s via `outOfCombatMoveSpeed` in `formulas.ts` (Float Stone reads `effect.tiers` in production bundles; `conditionalEffects` is empty there). UI components (`StatPanel`, `CompareView`, `LevelGraph`) consume `DerivedBuild` only—changing formulas happens in `src/engine/` without touching components.

Game facts live in zod-validated JSON loaded via `src/data/loadBundle.ts`, with lookup maps exposed via `src/data/gameData.ts`. The build-time baseline is `src/data/patch-current.json` (stable filename; `patchVersion` is inside the JSON; 95 playable Pokémon as of `lastUpdated` 2026-06-22). The published runtime copy under `public/data/` is version-stamped (`patch-<version>.json` plus `manifest.json`) for cache-busting and is produced by the data refresh workflow. Numeric data is refreshed by Python tooling under `tools/community/`—hand-editing bundle JSON is discouraged; curated builds and label overrides belong in `curated_builds.json` (see below). `normalize.py` builds two description tiers per move and passive: Basic in `description` (UNITE-DB text from `_raw/`, blank-filled from Serebii via `move_descriptions.json` when empty—with trailing `Activates at Level N` stripped by `strip_activation_note()`—plus upgrade bonus lines on Move 1/2 upgrades unless `description2` is cleared for verbatim upgrade text) and optional Advanced in `descriptionAdvanced` (UNITE-DB `rsb` detailed text via `advanced_desc()`). Unite moves also surface unlock level as `upgradeLevel` from the raw skill's `level` (`MANUAL_LEVEL` covers rare UNITE-DB gaps). Blank passive Basic text is backfilled from `rsb.true_desc` when UNITE-DB's top-level `description` is empty. Source mirrors: `tools/community/_raw/pokemon.json` and `_raw/stats.json`. Art mirrors under `public/assets/` and resolves portably via `src/ui/asset.ts` (supports relative `base: "./"` for static hosts and GitHub Pages sub-paths).

Recommendations (`src/engine/recommend.ts`) sit beside the engine but must respect the same stat model and owned-emblem inventory semantics as the editor.

Emblem build search (`src/engine/emblemSearch/`) is a separate pure-TS subsystem orchestrated by `orchestrator.ts` (recipe solver, exact color + mixed-grade enumeration when the grade-aware space is ≤ `exactCap`, else heuristic passes; parallel shard workers when available). `shouldRunExact` compares the grade-aware enumeration count to `DEFAULT_EXACT_CAP` (1e9). Pool construction (`pool.ts`, `PoolConfig`) supports **Owned only** vs **Full dataset**, **Mixed grades** (default on — Bronze/Silver/Gold can differ per slot; off uses highest grade), and per-grade filters on the full dataset; `enumerateGradeVariants` follows the mixed-grades toggle. The Optimize tab is driven by the global Basic/Advanced toggle (`expert` from `useStore`): `EmblemOptimizer` is a thin container; `useEmblemOptimizer` (`src/state/useEmblemOptimizer.ts`) owns all optimizer UI state (lifted so Basic↔Advanced flips preserve history, level, and apply state); presentational pieces live under `src/components/optimizer/`. Search runs via `useEmblemSearch` in `src/state/emblemSearch.ts` (Web Workers with main-thread fallback); applying a result calls `dispatch({ type: "applyBuild", emblems })`. Per-Pokémon presets in `src/data/emblemOptimizerPresets.json` are generated by `npm run generate:presets` (`tools/meta-defaults/`), refreshed after `data.yml` normalize, and guarded by `presetsSync.test.ts`. Search scoring reuses engine stat evaluation (`evaluate.ts`, `predictStats.ts`) and meta defaults from `optimizerPresets.ts` / `deriveBasicObjective`. After a search, `ResultCards.tsx` previews effective stats via `deriveEmblemLoadoutImpact` in `pokemonScore.ts` — emblem-only `computeEffectiveStats` (same stacking as the Build tab, excluding held items), with per-stat deltas vs no emblems, a level 1–15 preview slider, OOC move speed, and active set-bonus labels.

### Engine-First, UI-Second Boundary

`src/engine/` modules are pure TypeScript with Vitest coverage. `formulas.ts`, `emblems.ts`, `attackSpeed.ts`, `effects.ts`, and `derive.ts` must remain free of React/DOM imports. New combat mechanics extend the engine and data schema first; UI toggles and panels follow.

Treat these paths as frozen unless a task explicitly requires engine or data-pipeline changes: `src/engine/` (including `src/engine/emblemSearch/`), `tools/`, `src/state/loadout.ts`, `src/state/heldItemGrades.ts`. Patch bundles under `src/data/` and `public/data/` are normally pipeline-generated; the baseline uses a stable filename while the published copy is version-stamped (see Data Bundle Versioning). Loadout/editor state lives in `src/state/store.tsx`; emblem search session state lives in `src/state/emblemSearch.ts`; optimizer UI state lives in `src/state/useEmblemOptimizer.ts`; compare preset resolution lives in `src/state/compareBuilds.ts` (pure TS, unit-tested) — none of those four state modules are interchangeable.

### Single Derivation Path

All effective-stat rendering goes through `deriveBuild`. Level-scaling graphs use `deriveAtLevel` rather than duplicating stacking logic. Violating this leads to StatPanel/CompareView drift. `StatPanel` shows `oocMoveSpeed` separately from the in-combat Move Speed row (with a delta when higher). `LevelGraph` graphs in-combat `effective.moveSpeed` only; `CompareView` does not surface OOC move speed. `CompareView` resolves held-item grades per compared loadout via `heldItemGrade(id)` on each held slot (not the Build tab's positional `heldSlotGrades`). Optimizer results (`ResultCards`) call `deriveEmblemLoadoutImpact` in `pokemonScore.ts` for the same `computeEffectiveStats` stacking on emblem-only loadouts (not the full saved loadout via `deriveBuild`).

Formatting for display: `src/ui/format.ts` (`STAT_ROWS`, `formatStat`, `formatDelta`, `formatExactDelta`). Never reimplement stat math or formatting in components.

### Integration Contract (`useStore`)

`loadout`, `dispatch` — the in-progress build + reducer (`setPokemon`, `setLevel`, `setHeldItem`, `setBattleItem`, `addEmblem`, `removeEmblem`, `setEmblemGrade`, `toggleBoost`, `setMove`, `applyBuild`, `load`, `reset`).

`saved`, `save`, `remove`, `loadSaved`, `saveError`, `shareUrl()` — saved loadouts + sharing.

`owned`, `toggleOwned`, `bulkSetOwned`, `replaceOwned` — emblem inventory (`replaceOwned` replaces the full set on file import).

`mode` (`"beginner" | "expert"`), `setMode`, `expert` — global Basic/Advanced mode (UI labels **Basic** / **Advanced**; stored values unchanged). Drives optimizer depth, Compare tab visibility, emblem stat precision, and move/passive tooltip description tier (`pickDescription` in `tips.tsx`).

`heldItemGrade(id)`, `setHeldItemGradeById(id, g)`, `heldSlotGrades`, `setHeldItemGradeForSlot(slot, g)` — held-item grades.

`theme`, `themePref`, `setThemePref` — appearance (see Theming below).

Live stats: `deriveBuild(loadout, true, heldSlotGrades)` returns `{ pokemon, effective, base, attackSpeed, oocMoveSpeed, availableBoosts, emblemLoadout, buffedStats }`.

Emblem search (`useEmblemSearch` in `src/state/emblemSearch.ts`): `state` (`status`, `progress`, `eta`, `result`, `history`, `historyIndex`), `run`, `cancel`, `reset`, `clearResult`, `goHistory`. Reads `owned` from `useStore`; applying a pick calls `dispatch({ type: "applyBuild", emblems })`. Session cache is in-memory for the current page load (survives tab switches, not a full reload).

Emblem optimizer UI (`useEmblemOptimizer` in `src/state/useEmblemOptimizer.ts`): `useOwned` / `mixedGrades` / `allowedGrades` pool config, priority/color/effort/`exactCap` controls, search handlers, apply/toast, and optimize level. Composes `useEmblemSearch` for runs. Returns `shared` / `basic` / `advanced` prop bundles consumed by `BasicOptimizer` and `AdvancedOptimizer`. Result effective stats are computed inside `ResultCards.tsx` via `deriveEmblemLoadoutImpact` (not returned from the hook). Advanced **Search Pool** shows live build counts and an **⚡ Exact** vs **Smart search** badge when exact color constraints are active (`willRunExact`). Advanced **Color** (`ColorCard`) offers Off / Weighted / Exact modes; the Exact option is disabled when the current pool cannot satisfy the active color targets (`exactColorModeFeasible`), and pool changes auto-downgrade Exact → Weighted when targets become unachievable and auto-upgrade Weighted → Exact when feasibility returns (unless the user explicitly pinned Weighted). Pokémon-change and Reset seed colors via `deriveAdvancedColorUiDefaults` in `searchPresets.ts`. Optimizer control state is session-only (not localStorage); one hook instance keeps results, history, level, and apply state when flipping Basic↔Advanced. In Advanced mode, color constraints, protect floors, and stat priorities reset only on Pokémon change or explicit Reset to defaults — owned/full pool switches, mixed-grades toggles, grade filters, and inventory updates do not wipe those controls.

### Data Bundle Versioning

The build-time baseline bundle is `src/data/patch-current.json` plus optional sidecars (`attackSpeedBoosts.json`). The `patchVersion` field inside the JSON is the human-set patch id (`PATCH_VERSION` env in `normalize.py`, default `1.23.2.5` — UNITE-DB exposes no version). Roster-only additions bump `lastUpdated` and the published manifest `version` without changing `patchVersion`. Published copies land in `public/data/patch-<version>.json` with a `manifest.json` pointer whose `version` matches the bundle's `lastUpdated` (set by the data refresh workflow). At launch, `gameData.ts` calls `refreshDataInBackground`, which runs `checkDataNow` in `src/data/dataSource.ts` against the remote manifest; it downloads and caches validated payloads in localStorage (`unite-build-optimizer.dataCache.v1`) only when the remote `version` is strictly newer than the effective version (cached copy only when strictly newer than the baseline's `lastUpdated`, else the baseline — the same rule `activeRaw()` uses on load). `gameData.ts` loads via `activeRaw()`; cached data applies only when strictly newer than the baseline's `lastUpdated`, with a zod fallback to the shipped baseline on schema mismatch. Older or equal remote versions are ignored (no download, no reload banner). Schema changes require zod updates in `loadBundle.ts` and corresponding tests (including the curated-merge guard in `patchBundle.test.ts` and `checkDataNow` / `activeRaw` cases in `dataSource.test.ts`).

Each Pokémon may carry two build arrays:
- `builds` — **Recommended** tab (`RecommendPanel`) and Compare preset source; UNITE-DB builds emitted by `normalize.py`. Array order is the tab display order; the first entry auto-applies when the user switches Pokémon (`RecommendPanel`).
- `creativeBuilds` — **Creative** tab and Compare preset source (when complete builds exist); hand-curated community builds (not emitted by `normalize.py`). Compare and both Build-tab sources filter to complete 10-emblem sets only (`compareBuilds.presetBuilds`, same rule as `RecommendPanel`).

Runtime-only `builds` reordering (both patch copies, object fields unchanged) is occasionally applied for display/default-build preferences; `normalize.py` overwrites it unless the order is expressed as a per-Pokémon `builds` overlay in `curated_builds.json`.

Curated Recommended/Creative builds and build-label overrides live in `tools/community/curated_builds.json` and are merged by `normalize.py` (`apply_curated_builds`) after UNITE-DB normalization. **Do not hand-edit `emblemName` in patch JSON** — regeneration will clobber it. Instead:
- `_emblemNameRemap` (top-level): remap raw UNITE-DB `emblemName` strings across all Recommended builds before per-Pokémon overrides. A string value replaces unconditionally; an object value selects by the Pokémon's `role` (`AllRounder`, `Defender`, etc.).
- `_emblemNamePrefixRemap` (top-level): fallback after exact `_emblemNameRemap` misses — keys match as **prefixes** of the raw `emblemName` (same string-vs-role-object value semantics). Used for the `"Offense Leaning"` / `"Bulk Leaning"` families so UNITE-DB word-order drift in the trailing tokens still maps to role-aware display labels (e.g. Attacker → `Attack Damage Carry (ADC)`, other roles → `Standard <Role>`).
- Per Pokémon `id`: `builds` (replace Recommended), `creativeBuilds` (set Creative), and/or `recommendedTitles` (override `emblemName` by build index on raw Recommended builds — cosmetic flavor relabels or distinct labels when UNITE-DB reuses generic names, e.g. Scizor; array length should match Recommended count). `builds` and `recommendedTitles` are mutually exclusive; `creativeBuilds` may coexist with either (e.g. Decidueye carries both `recommendedTitles` and a Creative build).
- `lane` edits that aren't covered by remap use full `builds`/`creativeBuilds` overlay entries.

Per-Pokémon emblem-optimizer presets live in `src/data/emblemOptimizerPresets.json`, generated from each Pokémon's community builds (UNITE-DB `builds[]` + `creativeBuilds[]`, 10-emblem sets) by `tools/meta-defaults/generate-presets.ts`. They supply community-derived stat priorities, protect floors, and a color shell that replace the role-generic derivation in `deriveBasicObjective` when confident enough (fallback chain: manual `curated_builds.json` `emblemPreset` overlay → auto preset ≥ confidence threshold → generic). Regenerate after `builds` change: `npm run generate:presets` (or `npm run data:post-normalize` to re-run `normalize.py` first). Preview without writing: `npm run generate:presets:dry`. The daily `data.yml` workflow runs `generate:presets` automatically after normalize; CI fails if `src/data/__tests__/presetsSync.test.ts` detects a stale file. The engine consumes the JSON via `src/engine/emblemSearch/optimizerPresets.ts`.

Move Basic descriptions: `normalize.py` emits skill `description` / upgrade `description1` from `_raw/pokemon.json`, backfilling blanks from `move_descriptions.json` (`scrape_serebii.py`; slug map is explicit—do not derive slugs algorithmically). When UNITE-DB ships Advanced-only text for a new Pokémon, inject official Basic into those raw skill fields before normalize (Quaquaval). In `build_upgrade_move`, when `description1` embeds a bare `Upgrade:` marker and `level2` is set, it is promoted to `Upgrade (Level N):` before `paragraphize_upgrade` (idempotent — already-leveled markers are unchanged). Advanced text is not scraped—it is assembled locally by `advanced_desc()` from UNITE-DB `rsb` fields (`true_desc`, `add{N}_true_desc`, `notes`, `enhanced_true_desc` with `level2` for upgrade lines). Skills without `true_desc` omit `descriptionAdvanced` and the UI falls back to Basic. Unite-move unlock levels live in `upgradeLevel` (from UNITE-DB `skills[].level`, not Serebii activation text). Tooltip tier follows the global `expert` flag via `pickDescription` in `src/components/tips.tsx`; `moveTip` renders the header as name · move type · `Lv {upgradeLevel}` · cooldown when present. Wired in `MovesCard.tsx` (move rows, upgrade options, all Unite Moves via `uniteMoves()` in `src/engine/moves.ts` — dual-unite Pokémon like Urshifu and Blaziken show both, passive) and `RecommendPanel.tsx` (Final Moves). Move tooltip visuals below the text come from `MoveMedia.tsx`: self-recorded gameplay clip (`videoAsset`, id-keyed from `tools/community/move_clips.json` via `load_move_clips()` — `transcode_clips.py` crops 125px from each side and 100px from top/bottom of 1280×720 Switch captures to zoom past the HUD, then scales to 320w muted H.264 into `public/assets/skills/`), else animated WebP (`gifAsset` from `move_gifs.json`, name-keyed — only when no clip exists for that move), else static `iconAsset`; passives use GIF/icon only. `normalize.py` attaches `videoAsset` when a clip exists and skips `gifAsset` for that move; passives still get GIFs when available. `MoveMedia` falls back video → GIF → icon in a fixed max box with `object-contain`. `moveTip` passes all three tiers; the passive block in `MovesCard.tsx` passes GIF/icon only. Coverage is partial — 45 Pokémon keyed in `tools/community/move_clips.json` as of the current roster; `normalize.py` sets `videoAsset` on every move listed there; unlisted moves fall back to GIF or icon. Per-Pokémon staging under `tools/community/_clips/<pokemon-id>/` (each with a tracked `MOVES.txt`; raw `.mp4`/`.mov` in those folders are gitignored — commit new folders when added). Re-run `transcode_clips.py` then `normalize.py` when raw recordings land; step-by-step workflow: `../plans/2026-06-20-add-move-clips-runbook.md`. Dual-unite Pokémon (Urshifu, Blaziken) each carry eight clips when complete (both unite moves plus six other moves). In `RecommendPanel.tsx` and `CompareView.tsx` (`SidePicker`), the variant title between prev/next arrows shows `emblemName ?? name`, optional ` · lane`, and ` · n/total` when multiple builds; long titles scroll via `MarqueeText` (`src/ui/MarqueeText.tsx`, CSS in `src/index.css` — centered when they fit, duplicate-segment marquee when they overflow, horizontal scroll when `prefers-reduced-motion`). `RecommendPanel`'s Final Moves sub-block always resolves both slots via `resolveFinalMove` + `moveIdsFromNames` so partial or empty curated `moves` lists still show two icons matching the applied loadout.

### State and Persistence

- Current loadout auto-persists; saved loadouts capped at 20.
- Owned emblems are keyed per grade (Bronze/Silver/Gold in the Inventory UI; platinum is valid in storage and on file import) independently, persisted in localStorage (`unite-build-optimizer.ownedEmblems.v2` as a flat array of `emblemId:grade` strings). `InventoryManager` can export/import the full collection as `foxforge-owned-emblems.json` via `ownedEmblemsToFileJSON` / `parseOwnedEmblemsFile` in `src/state/loadout.ts` (import is a full replace through `replaceOwned`, not a merge; unknown emblem IDs from older patches are dropped when `validEmblemIds` is supplied).
- Held item grades (1–40) are global per item ID, not stored in saved builds or share links. Unique held items (`isUniqueHeldItem`) skip grade storage and controls entirely.
- Share links encode loadout state in the URL hash (`#b=`).
- Theme preference (`themePref`) and Basic/Advanced mode (`beginner`/`expert` in storage) persist locally (`unite-build-optimizer.theme.v1`, `unite-build-optimizer.mode.v1`).
- Collapsible card open state persists per section (`unite-build-optimizer.collapsed.{persistKey}`). First visit defaults (no stored toggle): Builds and Effective Stats open; in Advanced mode, Level Scaling, Attack Speed, Combat Analytics, and Active Effects also open. Held Items, Trainer Item, Emblems, Moves, and Save & Load stay closed. Each card falls back to its `defaultOpen` prop when localStorage has no value for that `persistKey`; returning users keep their last toggled state.
- Active tab (`build` | `optimize` | `compare` | `emblems` | `items`) persists locally (`unite-build-optimizer.tab.v1`) for fast-resume on reload.
- Optimizer pool/effort/priority/color controls are session-only (not localStorage). Search result history is in-memory via `useEmblemSearch` and survives tab switches while the Optimize subtree stays mounted (after the first Optimize visit; see Current UI Shell); a full reload clears it.
- Compare A/B source, Pokémon, and variant picks are session-only (`useState` in `CompareView`); only the Compare card's open/closed state persists (`persistKey="compare"`).

### Current UI Shell (`src/App.tsx`)

No router library — navigation is local React state.

- **App bar** — fixed top bar (`AppBar` from `src/components/shell/`), gradient from `--color-appbar-*` tokens, `pt-safe`. On the Build and Optimize tabs: selected Pokémon cropped thumbnail (`iconAsset`, same crop as the picker grid), name, role badge, and attack type. Icon and name are separate tappable buttons — both open the Pokémon picker overlay. With no Pokémon selected, the leading slot shows a plus affordance (`.poke-picker-empty`, accent border and static glow); with a selection, the thumbnail uses `.poke-picker-selected` and a `--color-poke-picker-ring` border (`aria-label` **Select Pokémon** vs **Change Pokémon**). On other tabs: static screen title ("Emblems", "Held Items", "Compare"). Single **Basic**/**Advanced** mode toggle (`ModeToggle` in `AppBar.tsx` — shows current mode, tap flips; color-coded via `--color-mode-*` tokens) and settings gear on all tabs.
- **Tab bar** — fixed bottom navigation (`TabBar`): Build · Optimize · Emblems · Items; Compare appears only in Advanced mode (5 tabs vs 4). Switching from Advanced to Basic while on Compare redirects to Build.
- **Build screen** — `BuildScreen` composes `RecommendPanel`, `LoadoutEditor`, `MovesCard`, `StatPanel`, `LevelGraph` (Advanced only; lazy-loaded via `React.lazy` + `Suspense` in `BuildScreen.tsx` so recharts is not in the initial bundle), then `LoadoutBar` (Save & Load). `StatPanel` Effective Stats shows per-stat deltas vs base in `text-pos` / `text-neg` via `formatExactDelta`, plus an out-of-combat move speed line below the grid (delta vs in-combat Move Speed when yellow set bonus and/or Float Stone apply). `LoadoutEditor` held-item slots use shared `GradeField` plus a grade slider (unique items skip both). Pokémon selection is not inline; the app-bar icon or title tap open `PokemonPickerSheet`.
- **Optimize screen** — `OptimizeScreen` → `EmblemOptimizer` (thin container: picks `BasicOptimizer` or `AdvancedOptimizer` from the global Basic/Advanced toggle; state in `useEmblemOptimizer`, presentational UI under `src/components/optimizer/`). Basic: one-tap search with auto-derived objectives plus **Owned only** / **Full dataset** toggle. Advanced: **Search Pool** (`SearchPoolCard` — owned/full, mixed grades, grade chips on full dataset, live build counts), **Mode & Effort** (`ModeEffortCard` — maximize/target, effort, adjustable `exactCap`), stat priorities, **Color** (`ColorCard` — off/weighted/exact; Exact disabled when the pool cannot hit active color targets). `App.tsx` lazy-loads `OptimizeScreen` and defers mounting until the first Optimize tab visit (`optimizeVisited` latch); once mounted, the subtree stays in a `hidden` wrapper when another tab is active so in-flight search and result history survive tab switches. Search runs off-thread when Workers are available (`src/workers/emblemSearch.worker.ts` plus shard workers); `SearchProgressOverlay` shows progress and ETA. The **Results** card (`ResultCards`) lists emblem picks and `EmblemSetSummary`, then a Build-tab-style **Effective stats** grid (emblem-only; deltas vs no emblems) with a level preview slider, OOC move speed line, and set-bonus labels. Apply writes emblem picks into the shared loadout via `dispatch({ type: "applyBuild", emblems })`; a link can jump to the Emblems tab for inventory edits.
- **Emblems screen** — `EmblemsScreen` renders `InventoryManager` (per-grade ownership, search, horizontal color chip filters, responsive emblem grid). A **Backup** row between the header and search exports/imports the full owned collection (all grades) as JSON (`↓ Export JSON` / `↑ Import JSON`, mirroring `LoadoutBar` file patterns).
- **Items screen** — `ItemsScreen` renders `HeldItemsInventory` (global held-item grades via shared `GradeField` with a `text-sm` "Grade" label, grade instructions with a tap-for-detail hint, 3-column tile grid on phones, `HeldItemDetailModal` on icon tap).
- **Compare screen** — `CompareScreen` renders `CompareView` (Advanced only). Lazy-loaded in `App.tsx` and mounted on demand when the Compare tab is active. Each side picks a source — Recommended, Creative (when that Pokémon has complete builds), Current, or Saved (when any exist) — then a Pokémon chip + variant cycler for presets, or a static current-build row / saved-loadout `<select>`. Preset sides show the build title (`emblemName ?? name`, lane, variant index) between prev/next arrows with the same `MarqueeText` overflow behavior as the Build tab. Side A defaults to the working build when a Pokémon is selected; side B to a Recommended preset for the same Pokémon. Selection resolves through `src/state/compareBuilds.ts` into loadouts for `deriveBuild`. A controlled `PokemonPickerSheet` opens per side without mutating the working build. Two-column side pickers stack on phones; the stat table scrolls horizontally inside its wrapper.
- **Layout** — single column, `max-w-2xl` centered, `gap-3` between sections. `<main>` padding clears the fixed app bar and tab bar (safe-area aware). Interactive controls target ≥44px hit areas (`min-h-11`); tappable labels use `text-sm` minimum.
- **Overlays** — `BottomSheet` (`src/components/shell/BottomSheet.tsx`) is the shared responsive overlay (bottom sheet on phones, centered card on `sm+`). On mobile (`max-width: 639px`), drag the grabber or header down to dismiss (`useSwipeToDismiss` + pure threshold logic in `src/ui/swipeDismiss.ts`); the scrollable body does not participate in the gesture; desktop modals stay undraggable. Callers: `SettingsMenu` (gear; Appearance theme picker, Updates with read-only patch version and app version/PWA-install copy, About, Legal with data attribution (Unite-DB, Serebii, in-game-text verification, Mathcord) and disclaimer), `PokemonPickerSheet` (app-bar icon or title tap on Build/Optimize; controlled per-side picker from `CompareView`; search does not auto-focus on open so the grid is browsable without the on-screen keyboard), and `PickerModal` (held/trainer/emblem pickers from `LoadoutEditor`; search does not auto-focus on open so the list is browsable without the on-screen keyboard). Picker callers pass `fillHeight` so the panel stays at fixed `88vh`/`80vh` while search filters results in place; `SettingsMenu` omits it and keeps content-fit sizing. `HeldItemDetailModal` keeps its existing centered-modal shell.
- **Footer** — Settings → Legal holds an inline attribution line (Unite-DB, Serebii, in-game-text verification, Mathcord), plus `LEGAL_DISCLAIMER` and `copyrightLine()` from `src/ui/brand.ts`; patch version appears only under Settings → Updates. Nothing from these sections is rendered in `App.tsx`.
- **Data updates** — startup `refreshDataInBackground` in `gameData.ts` dispatches `unite-data-updated` only when a strictly newer remote bundle was cached; `App.tsx` shows a reload banner inside `<main>`.

### Semantic Theming

UI surfaces use Tailwind v4 semantic tokens defined in `src/index.css` (`bg-surface`, `text-ink`, etc.), toggled via `data-theme` on the document root. Role/stat accent colors may stay literal; structural chrome must not hardcode light-only neutrals. Role badge classes (`ROLE_COLOR`) and solid filter-chip fills (`ROLE_FILTER_HEX`) live in `src/ui/theme.ts`; active picker role chips and emblem color chips pair those fills with `readableTextColor()` from `src/ui/colors.ts` for legible labels in light and dark mode. Native form controls (`<select>`, `<option>`) need explicit `bg-surface text-ink` so dropdown popups stay legible in dark mode (`color-scheme: dark`).

**Resolved themes:**

| `theme` | Palette |
| --- | --- |
| `light` | Clean & minimal — neutral surfaces, calm indigo accent |
| `dark` | Neon-graffiti brand — magenta→cyan accents, deep purple-black surfaces |

**Preference API** (`src/state/store.tsx`):

| Member | Type | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `theme` | `"light" \| "dark"` | Resolved applied theme |
| `themePref` | `"system" \| "light" \| "dark"` | Stored preference (default `"system"`) |
| `setThemePref` | `(p: ThemePref) => void` | Sets preference and resolves `theme` |

`system` follows `prefers-color-scheme`, defaulting to dark when the OS states no preference. A `matchMedia` listener updates `theme` live while `themePref === "system"`. Resolved theme sets `document.documentElement.dataset.theme` and the `theme-color` meta (`#110d1f` dark, `#ffffff` light). Explicit `light`/`dark` persist in localStorage; `system` removes the key.

`SettingsMenu` → Appearance exposes a 3-way `System · Light · Dark` control bound to `themePref` / `setThemePref`.

**Token families in `src/index.css`:** core surfaces (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, …), tone cards (`--color-rec-*`, `--color-as-*`, `--color-an-*`), picker tiles (`--color-mon-*`), grade controls (`--color-grade-*`), app-bar tokens (`--color-appbar-*`, `--color-poke-picker-ring` for the selected app-bar thumbnail), tab-bar tokens (`--color-tab-*`), mode-toggle pill (`--color-mode-basic-*`, `--color-mode-advanced-*`). App-bar Pokémon picker chrome (`.poke-picker-empty`, `.poke-picker-selected`) lives in the same file. Safe-area helpers: `@utility pt-safe` / `pb-safe` via `env(safe-area-inset-*)`. Viewport meta includes `viewport-fit=cover` in `index.html` and intentionally omits `maximum-scale=1` / `user-scalable=no` so pinch-zoom stays available. Base polish also forces `font-size: 16px` on text-entry controls (`input` except range/checkbox/radio, `select`, `textarea`) so iOS Safari does not auto-zoom on focus; the `:not([type=…])` chain keeps specificity above Tailwind `.text-sm`.

Branding constants: `src/ui/brand.ts`, `docs/08-branding.md`. Historical token rationale: `docs/06-theme-plan.md`.

### Web distribution & build

FoxForge GG ships as a **hosted PWA only** — no native desktop shell. The same Vite build serves local dev, installable PWA (`base: "./"`), and GitHub Pages (`VITE_BASE=/FoxForge-GG/` via `npm run build:pages`). [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs lint, format check, typecheck, tests, and accuracy gates on every push and pull request. [`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml) redeploys to GitHub Pages on push to `main` (after the same accuracy gates, then `build:pages`). Game-data refresh runs daily at 09:00 UTC (and on demand) via [`.github/workflows/data.yml`](.github/workflows/data.yml): scrape/normalize, mirror new art (`fetch_art.py`), validate (lint, format check, `verifyPatch.ts`, `npm test`, `validate:art`), publish to `public/data/`, and open or update a PR on `data/auto-refresh` with a semantic changelog from `tools/community/diff_bundle.py` (new entities flagged for curation). When that PR already exists, a follow-up `@AeroKita` comment re-notifies on each update — it never commits directly to `main`.

Two independent update channels: **app code** (PWA service worker picks up a new deploy on reload) and **game data** (`refreshDataInBackground` / `checkDataNow` in `src/data/dataSource.ts` fetches `data/manifest.json` from Pages, caches strictly newer payloads to localStorage, and `gameData.ts` applies them on the next load via `activeRaw()`; see `docs/07-distribution.md`). `vite.config.ts` encodes Pages-specific service-worker self-destruct behavior to avoid stale-cache blank screens—distribution concerns live in config, not business logic.

### Documentation Authority

Human-oriented deep dives live in `docs/` (architecture, calculation engine, data sourcing, distribution, branding). [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) is the step-by-step guide for human contributors (setup, TDD workflow, `npm run verify`, PR checklist). GitHub auto-fills [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) on new PRs (conventional-commit title, UI screenshots, test notes). When behavior is ambiguous, those docs and engine validation tests are the source of truth—not comments in components.

## Tech Stack & Tooling

TypeScript/React SPA with a pure calculation engine and community-sourced game data pipelines.

### Environment Setup

- **Node.js 24+** (pinned in `.node-version`; matches CI in `.github/workflows/`).
- **npm** for JS dependencies and scripts (`package.json`).
- **Python 3** with a venv under `tools/extract/.venv` for community data refresh scripts (`tools/community/`).

Clone, `npm install`, and you're ready to develop. The `prepare` script installs a Husky pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit`) that runs `lint-staged` to auto-format staged `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` and `vite.config.ts` with oxfmt before each commit.

### Build Tools

| Tool | Role | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vite 8 | Dev server, production bundler, Vitest host | `vite.config.ts` |
| TypeScript | Type-checking (`tsc --noEmit`) | `tsconfig.json` |
| Tailwind CSS v4 | Semantic token styling via `@tailwindcss/vite` | `src/index.css`, `vite.config.ts` |
| vite-plugin-pwa | PWA manifest + Workbox caching (non-Pages builds) | `vite.config.ts` |
| oxlint | Lint (React hooks, correctness category); CI fails on errors | `.oxlintrc.json` |
| oxfmt | Format TS/TSX (Prettier-compatible); data JSON bundles are excluded | `.oxfmtrc.json` |
| Husky + lint-staged | Pre-commit oxfmt on staged TS/TSX; configured in `package.json` `lint-staged` | `.husky/pre-commit` |

Key scripts (from `package.json`): `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run build:pages`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run lint:fix`, `npm run format`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run verify`.

App version shown in Settings → Updates comes from the `"version"` field in `package.json` (currently `1.3.6`), injected at build time via `vite.config.ts` (`define.__APP_VERSION__`) into `src/ui/version.ts` (`APP_VERSION`). Bump with `npm version <semver> --no-git-tag-version` (or edit `package.json` and sync `package-lock.json`).

### Testing Process

Tests run in **Vitest** with `environment: "node"`, matching `src/**/*.test.ts` (configured in `vite.config.ts`).

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | oxlint — errors fail CI; `react/exhaustive-deps` is warn-only |
| `npm run format:check` | oxfmt `--check` on `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` and `vite.config.ts` |
| `npm test` | Engine (including `derive.test.ts` for out-of-combat move speed, `src/engine/__tests__/moves.test.ts` for move-selection helpers including `uniteMoves`), emblem search (including `gradeEnumeration`, `exactCap`, `poolFeatures`, `searchPresets`, `emblemLoadoutImpact`), bundle (including Basic/Advanced move description fields, bare-`Upgrade:` level promotion on Basic move text, Unite-move `upgradeLevel` and activation-note cleanup, move `videoAsset`/`gifAsset` paths, no redundant `gifAsset` when `videoAsset` is set, and a roster-agnostic no-clip fallback invariant in `patchBundle.test.ts`), dataSource (`activeRaw` + `checkDataNow`), attack-speed, share, state (including `src/state/__tests__/loadout.test.ts` for loadout share/file round-trips and owned-emblem inventory file export/import, and `src/state/__tests__/compareBuilds.test.ts` for compare preset resolution), and UI pure-logic unit tests (e.g. `src/components/__tests__/tips.test.ts` for `pickDescription`, `src/ui/__tests__/format.test.ts` for `formatExactDelta`, `src/ui/__tests__/swipeDismiss.test.ts`) |
| `npm run validate` | Known-values gate from `docs/03-Calculation-Engine.md` |
| `npx tsx src/data/verifyPatch.ts` | End-to-end zod validation of the bundle (prints roster count; known-value gates) |
| `npm run validate:art` | Validates mirrored image assets under `public/assets/` are real PNG/JPEG/WebP (not corrupt/HTML); `.mp4`/`.webm` move preview clips are skipped |
| `python3 -m unittest tools/community/test_diff_bundle.py tools/community/test_normalize.py` | Semantic bundle-diff changelog (`diff_bundle.py`) and `normalize.py` helpers (`strip_activation_note`, bare-`Upgrade:` promotion in `build_upgrade_move`) |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run verify` | Full CI gate locally: lint → format:check → typecheck → test → validate → verifyPatch → validate:art |

Every push and PR runs the full gate via `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint through `validate:art`, in that order). Local pre-push equivalent:

```bash
npm run verify
```

Game data refresh (separate `data.yml` workflow):

```bash
cd tools/community && source ../extract/.venv/bin/activate
python3 fetch.py && python3 scrape_serebii.py && python3 normalize.py && cd ../.. && npm run generate:presets && cd tools/community && python3 fetch_art.py && python3 normalize_as_boosts.py
```

`scrape_serebii.py` fetches Serebii move text into `move_descriptions.json` (run after `fetch.py`, before `normalize.py`). `normalize.py` writes `src/data/patch-current.json`; the Refresh game data workflow copies it to `public/data/patch-<version>.json`, updates `manifest.json`, mirrors art, and posts a field-level PR changelog via `diff_bundle.py` (or sync manually when running locally). Edit `curated_builds.json` (`_emblemNameRemap`, `_emblemNamePrefixRemap`, per-Pokémon `builds`/`creativeBuilds`/`recommendedTitles`) before re-running — never hand-edit curated labels in the bundle. Use a per-Pokémon `builds` overlay (not `recommendedTitles`) when both display order and labels must stay pinned against UNITE-DB reordering. Bump the patch id via `PATCH_VERSION=… python3 normalize.py` or the workflow's optional `patch_version` input.

Single-Pokémon roster add (when full `fetch.py` would pull unrelated drift from live UNITE-DB): append that Pokémon's rows to `_raw/pokemon.json` and `_raw/stats.json`, inject any missing Basic move/passive text into the raw skill fields, add curated `builds` in `curated_builds.json` when the raw placeholder is empty (e.g. Quaquaval's **Serving Looks** / **Carnival King**), then `normalize.py` → `npm run generate:presets` → `fetch_art.py` → copy to `public/data/` and bump `manifest.json` `version` to the bundle's `lastUpdated`. Regenerate only — do not hand-edit `patch-current.json`.

Curated-build-only edits (no UNITE-DB re-scrape):

```bash
npm run data:post-normalize   # normalize.py + emblemOptimizerPresets.json
npx tsx src/data/verifyPatch.ts && npm run typecheck && npm test
```

To refresh move descriptions only (no UNITE-DB re-scrape):

```bash
python3 tools/community/scrape_serebii.py && python3 tools/community/normalize.py
```

### Design System

Semantic color and surface tokens are defined in `src/index.css` using Tailwind v4 `@theme` blocks; dark overrides live under `[data-theme="dark"]`. Components should use generated utilities (`bg-surface`, `text-ink`, `border-line`, etc.) rather than raw palette classes for chrome.

Stat role colors (positive/negative, recommend/attack-speed/analytics tone cards) are intentional literals layered on top of semantic surfaces.

Shared modal behavior (`Escape` + scroll lock): `src/ui/useModalDismiss.ts` (used by `BottomSheet`, `HeldItemDetailModal`, and the touch long-press pinned popup in `Tooltip.tsx`). Mobile swipe-to-dismiss: `src/ui/useSwipeToDismiss.ts` (DOM wiring) and `src/ui/swipeDismiss.ts` (pure dismiss thresholds, unit-tested). `BottomSheet` (`src/components/shell/BottomSheet.tsx`) is the shared responsive overlay primitive; callers are `SettingsMenu`, `PokemonPickerSheet`, and `PickerModal`. Pickers pass optional `fillHeight` for a constant panel height during live filtering; Settings stays content-fit.

`Tooltip.tsx` wraps emblems, moves, trainer items, and held items: CSS hover tooltip on mouse; touch/pen long-press (~500 ms) opens the same content in a dismissible centered popup (backdrop tap, Escape). Movement cancels the press; the trailing tap is suppressed so long-press does not trigger underlying controls.

Mobile layout conventions: column spacing `gap-3`; `CollapsibleCard` headers `px-4 py-3` with `min-h-11` tap row; buttons, chips, tab items, the app-bar mode toggle, picker tiles, sliders, and emblem grade dots use ≥44px hit areas. Section collapse uses `CollapsibleCard` (`src/components/CollapsibleCard.tsx`) — open state is per `persistKey`, not a global default.

## Key Components

| Area | Path |
| --- | --- |
| App shell | `src/App.tsx` |
| Shell primitives | `src/components/shell/AppBar.tsx`, `TabBar.tsx`, `BottomSheet.tsx` (mobile swipe-to-dismiss via `src/ui/useSwipeToDismiss.ts`) |
| Build tab | `src/components/screens/BuildScreen.tsx` — `RecommendPanel` (variant title via `MarqueeText`), `LoadoutEditor`, `MovesCard`, `StatPanel`, `LevelGraph` (Advanced; lazy-loaded), `LoadoutBar` |
| Optimize tab | `src/components/screens/OptimizeScreen.tsx` → `EmblemOptimizer.tsx` → `BasicOptimizer` / `AdvancedOptimizer` (lazy-loaded in `App.tsx`; visit-latch keeps subtree mounted after first open) |
| Optimizer UI | `src/components/optimizer/` — `shared.tsx`, `ResultCards` (effective-stats preview via `deriveEmblemLoadoutImpact`), `BasicOptimizer`, `AdvancedOptimizer`, `advanced/SearchPoolCard.tsx`, `advanced/ModeEffortCard.tsx`, `advanced/ColorCard.tsx` (exact mode gated by pool feasibility), other `advanced/*Card.tsx` |
| Emblem optimizer hook | `src/state/useEmblemOptimizer.ts` — lifted Basic+Advanced state, search wiring, apply/toast |
| Emblem search engine | `src/engine/emblemSearch/` — `orchestrator.ts`, `pool.ts`, `evaluate.ts`, `pokemonScore.ts` (`deriveEmblemLoadoutImpact` for result preview), `basicObjective.ts`, `optimizerPresets.ts`; workers under `src/workers/` |
| Emblem search state | `src/state/emblemSearch.ts` (`useEmblemSearch`), `src/state/searchWorkerController.ts` |
| Archived UI | `archive/BuildSummaryBar.tsx` — removed Build tab glance hero (2026-06-19); outside `src/`, not compiled; restore notes in the file header and `archive/README.md` |
| Pokémon picker | `PokemonPickerSheet` in `src/components/PokemonPicker.tsx` (`BottomSheet fillHeight`; role filter chips color-coded when active via `ROLE_FILTER_HEX`; search does not auto-focus on open). Optional controlled `selectedId` / `onSelect` / `title` for Compare side-picking; omit to bind to the store via `setPokemon` (Build/Optimize app bar). |
| Emblems tab | `src/components/screens/EmblemsScreen.tsx` → `InventoryManager` (per-grade grid + JSON backup import/export) |
| Items tab | `src/components/screens/ItemsScreen.tsx` → `HeldItemsInventory` (`HeldItemDetailModal`) |
| Compare tab (Advanced) | `src/components/screens/CompareScreen.tsx` → `CompareView` (lazy-loaded in `App.tsx`; preset title via `MarqueeText` in `SidePicker`); preset/loadout resolution in `src/state/compareBuilds.ts` (unit-tested) |
| Pickers / settings | `PickerModal` (`BottomSheet fillHeight`; search does not auto-focus on open), `SettingsMenu` (content-fit `BottomSheet`; read-only patch version + app version) |
| Overflow labels | `src/ui/MarqueeText.tsx` — horizontal scroll for overflowing one-line text (Build tab variant title in `RecommendPanel`; Compare tab preset title in `CompareView` `SidePicker`; `prefers-reduced-motion` uses native scroll) |
| Grade input | `src/components/GradeField.tsx` — shared tap-to-type grade field (`HeldItemsInventory`, `LoadoutEditor` held-item slots) |
| Item detail | `src/ui/heldItemDetail.tsx` (`HeldItemDetailModal`; re-exports `activeTierIndex` from `formulas.ts`) |
| Tooltips | `src/components/Tooltip.tsx` (hover + touch long-press popup), `src/components/tips.tsx` (`pickDescription`, `moveTip` with name · type · Lv · CD header when `upgradeLevel` is set; move/passive tier follows `expert`), `src/components/MoveMedia.tsx` (move tooltip visual: video → GIF → icon) |
| State | `src/state/store.tsx`, `src/state/loadout.ts`, `src/state/heldItemGrades.ts`, `src/state/compareBuilds.ts` |
| Engine | `src/engine/derive.ts`, `src/engine/formulas.ts` (`computeEffectiveStats`, `outOfCombatMoveSpeed`, `activeTierIndex`), `src/engine/moves.ts` (`baseMove`, `upgradeOptions`, `uniteMoves`, `resolveFinalMove`) |
| Data | `src/data/gameData.ts`, `src/data/loadBundle.ts`, `src/data/dataSource.ts` |
